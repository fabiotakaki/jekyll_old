## About me
Hi ! My name is FÃ¡bio da Silva Takaki. I'm currently student at UNESP - Universidade Estadual Paulista, Presidente Prudente - Brazil.

I'm a proud member of project at university called `CETAS`, from Geograph Departament where we research about labor law related to worker's health.
So, I'm responsible to develop a web system that will store all data researched in a structured database to project.

In this blog, I will try to share some knowledge about WEB, Computer Science and maybe things from my university (Articles, Works, developed by me).

I'm horrible writer, but good intention to training write and to learn English, doesn't lack for me ! :)

Thanks a lot to your visit !
