## About me

Hi! My name is Fabio da Silva Takaki. I’m 21 years old and I’m from Presidente Prudente, Brazil. I'm currently a student at the University of the State of Sao Paulo (UNESP). I’m a proud member of a project at University called  `CETAS`, where we research about labor law related to worker’s health. So, I’m responsible for developing a web system that will store all data researched.

In this blog, I will try to share some knowledge about WEB, Computer Science and maybe things from my university (Articles, Works, developed by me).

I'm horrible writer, but I have good intention to learn English and share knowledge! :)

Thanks!
