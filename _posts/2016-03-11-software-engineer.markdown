Hello,
I'm here to share a very good article about Software Engineer, differentiating the Good Engineers of the Bad Engineers.
The article was indication from my teacher of Software Engineer, *[Dr. Rogério Eduardo Garcia][rogerio-eduardo-garcia]{:target="_blank"}*, which tells relatively important points that should have good engineers that bad engineers have not.

According to Wikipédia, Engineer is:
"An engineer is a practitioner of engineering, concerned with applying scientific knowledge, mathematics, and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical, societal and commercial problems. Engineers design materials, structures, and systems while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost.".

Therefore, to develop good solutions for software, Good Engineers have to know knowledge and attitude necessary to be good. When clients arrive to us with a problem, Good Engineers should have to know translate this problem and abstract not only to machine language, but also to programmers and engineers. Several other points are treated in this Article.

So, follow the link to the article: [Good and Bad Engineers][good-bad-software-engineer]{:target="_blank"} written by Katsuya Noguchi.

If you liked this post and the article, please comment ! Tell us your opinion, do you agree with points mentioned in Article ? Let's share knowledge ! :)
